          I would have expected this to work, but it blows up saying I need to
          mark with &quot;use client&quot;. This works in my actual app but for
          some reason is behaving differently here.

        <p>
          This is a workaround some of the folks here have used with success,
          but again is not working here. You create a file with &quot;use
          client&quot; at the top in your app that re-exports the client
          components you want to use.
        </p>

        <h2>
          ‚ùå Server component in shared library that includes a client component{" "}
        </h2>
        <p>
          I should be able to load a server component from a shared library, and
          that component includes a Client component marked with `use client` in
          that shared library. I could not get this to work in my actual app,
          nor in this minimal environment.
